    Product & Service Introduction:
    ===============================
    Telegram is a freeware, cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging (IM)
    service. The service also provides end-to-end encrypted video calling,
    VoIP, file sharing and several other features. It was launched for iOS on
    14 August 2013 and Android in October 2013. The servers of Telegram are
    distributed worldwide to decrease frequent data load with five data centers
    in different regions, while the operational center is based in Dubai in the
    United Arab Emirates. Various client apps are available for desktop and
    mobile platforms including official apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS
    and Linux (although registration requires an iOS or Android device and a
    working phone number). There are also two official Telegram web twin apps –
    WebK and WebZ – and numerous unofficial clients that make use of Telegram's
    protocol. All of Telegram's official components are open source, with the
    exception of the server which is closed-sourced and proprietary.
    
    Telegram provides end-to-end encrypted voice and video calls and optional
    end-to-end encrypted "secret" chats. Cloud chats and groups are encrypted
    between the app and the server, so that ISPs and other third-parties on the
    network can't access data, but the Telegram server can. Users can send text
    and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share an unlimited
    number of images, documents (2 GB per file), user locations, animated
    stickers, contacts, and audio files. In January 2021, Telegram surpassed
    500 million monthly active users. It was the most downloaded app worldwide
    in January 2021 with 1 billion downloads globally as of late August 2021.

    1.1
    A Denial of Service (DOS) attack is a type of cyberattack in which a
    malicious person performs an attack with the aim of removing the resources
    of a system from the reach of its users.
    It is natural that if this attack is successful, the result will be a
    slowdown or disabling of the equipment and resources available to the
    victim.
    For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web
    vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
    
    
    PoC: Exploitation
