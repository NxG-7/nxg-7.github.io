    # Exploit Title: Roxy File Manager 1.4.5 PHP File Upload Restriction Bypass
    # Exploit Author: Adam Shebani (NULLHE4D)
    # Date: 07/03/2022
    # Software: Roxy File Manager
    # Version: 1.4.5
    # CVE: CVE-2018-20525
    # Vendor Homepage: http://www.roxyfileman.com/
    # Software Link: http://www.roxyfileman.com/download.php?f=1.4.5-php
    # Tested on: PHP 7.2 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and PHP 7.4 on Windows 10
    
    
    # Roxy File Manager 1.4.5 restricts uploading files with certain
    # extensions, including various PHP extensions. These forbidden
    # extensions are configured in a file called 'conf.json' at the root
    # of the file manager's code base. Sections #1 and #1.1 at
    # https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46085 demonstrate a directory
    # traversal vulnerability that allows exfiltrating arbitrary
    # directories by copying them to a directory accessible through the
    # file manager's web interface. The same vulnerability can be used
    # to overwrite the 'conf.json' file by copying a directory
    # containing a modified configuration file that has been uploaded.
    # The directory must have the same name as the original
    # configuration file's parent directory (usually 'fileman'). The
    # source and destination directories will be merged and files from
    # the destination directory get overwritten by the ones from the
    # source if they have the same name.
